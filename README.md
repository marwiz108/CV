## Marwa Elali

Full-stack junior software developer with an interest in back-end and DevOps. I am passionate about equality of all forms and women's rights, and I hope to make meaningful contributions to the rise in women in tech, as well as women in more senior positions. I am looking for full-stack or back-end heavy roles, preferably with a varied tech stack, as it will allow me to expand my knowledge and explore different kinds of technologies. I am keen on working in a friendly and supportive environment, where I can develop my skillset and grow as a valuable member of the company.

## Skills
- Fast, independent learner:<br>
  At Makers I learned two languages throughout the course with very little previous knowledge. We started learning Ruby, and by week 5 I learned JavaScript and developed a tested back-end program in one week. Makers has given me the capability to pick up any language or skill quickly, while focusing on TDD and XP values. I am now learning Java as it is one of the most versatile languages and is platform independent.

- Communication & team work:<br>
  Having to work in teams and pair programming throughout the course, my communication skills have improved greatly. I am confident with explaining concepts in an understandable way, and work well in teams - I enjoyed working on our team final project and adopting the Agile workflow. I have also learned how to give and receive constructive feedback.

- Software craftsmanship:<br>
  There was always focus on TDD and XP values in the projects I've done. I have improved my skills for writing clean, quality code that can be understood and used by others.

- Problem solving:<br>
